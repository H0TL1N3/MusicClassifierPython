# Music Classifier GUI program for ValTehPamati course

## Steps to compile
1. Install Python 3.11 on your system as it will be used for this project. If you're on Windows, you can get a binary release, version 3.11.9, from [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
2. Set up a virtual environment using either the command line or your IDE of choice. Here's a [guide on how to do that in PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html#python_create_virtual_env).
3. Install all required libraries from the requirements.txt - once again, PyCharm should take care of that and notify you about this need.
4. You can now compile the project and play around with it.

## IMPORTANT: Please Note that the project is not yet complete.
### TODO List:
1. Add models (BERT, NB)...
2. Implement functions that will classify the text.
3. Implement the player itself.
